# Swarm Network: Earn NLOV with CPU, GPU, and Mobile on Solana (April 15, 2025)
---
The landscape is shifting, and Swarm Network is leading the charge. Launching April 15, 2025, this Solana-based decentralized compute platform lets you connect CPU, GPU, or mobile devices via WebGPU to earn NLOV, with a 20% bonus for early adopters. This is your chance to monetize hardware and shape Web3. Let’s dive in.

## What is a Swarm Network?

Swarm Network is a marketplace where device owners (CPU, GPU, mobile) register resources and earn NLOV by fulfilling compute tasks for creators. Built on Solana, it uses smart contracts for task management and a React/TypeScript frontend with a real-time dashboard. Web GPU extends access to mobile users, democratizing participation.

## Core Components

- Smart Contracts: Rust/Anchor for device registration, task allocation, and NLOV rewards.
- Frontend: Wallet-integrated dashboard to track earnings.
- Backend: Supabase for data, task queue, and analytics.

## Key Features

- Device Management: Register any device, and monitor specs (VRAM, hash rate, Web GPU).
- Task System: Resource-matching algorithm pairs devices with tasks.
- Economic Model: NLOV rewards, staking for security, and performance incentives.

## Why It’s a Crypto Win

- Universal Access: CPU, GPU, mobile — everyone can earn.
- Early Rewards: 20% NLOV bonus expires April 15.
- Community Governance: NLOV holders influence the network.

## How to Join

Register your device, connect your Solana wallet, and watch NLOV grow on the dashboard. Security features like on-chain validation protect your earnings. Sign up at [app.neurolov.ai](https://app.neurolov.ai) to claim your 20% bonus.

## Conclusion

Swarm Network redefines crypto earnings with multi-device flexibility and NLOV rewards. Don’t miss the April 15 launch — join at [app.neurolov.ai](https://app.neurolov.ai) and lead the swarm!
