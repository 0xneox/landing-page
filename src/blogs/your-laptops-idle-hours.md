# Your Laptop’s Idle Hours Could Be Your Most Valuable Asset.

---

Every day, your laptop sits idle — while you’re on lunch, in a meeting, or sleeping.  
Those hours? Wasted power.

But in the world we’re building with NeuroSwarm, that power becomes your income.  
It contributes to decentralized AI infrastructure — powering models, research, and tools. And you get rewarded in return.

Think of your device not as a tool, but as a contributor. A silent worker.

NeuroSwarm is built for people who never thought they’d be part of Web3.  
No wallets, no jargon — just a tab and a mission.
