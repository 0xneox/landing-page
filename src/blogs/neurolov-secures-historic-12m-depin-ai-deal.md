# Neurolov Secures Historic $12M DePIN AI Deal with Government to Power Sustainable, Decentralized GPU Computing
[Read on Medium](https://neurolov.medium.com/neurolov-secures-historic-12m-depin-ai-deal-with-government-to-power-sustainable-decentralized-d32a6ab147ea)

At Neurolov, we’ve always believed that compute shouldn’t be locked behind paywalls, data centers, and Big Tech monopolies. It should be accessible, sustainable, and community-powered.

Now, that vision is officially backed — by a $12 million government agreement.

At the 2025 Vibrant Gujarat Summit, Neurolov signed a groundbreaking $12M Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with government support to scale our browser-based GPU-sharing network across critical sectors like smart cities, healthcare. This partnership, endorsed by Chief Minister Bhupendra Bhai Patel, marks a historic moment for the global DePIN movement.

## A Broken AI Infrastructure — And a $2 Trillion Opportunity
AI is rapidly becoming the fabric of every industry, from classrooms and hospitals to research labs and content creation studios. The global AI market is on track to grow from $136.6 billion in 2022 to $1.81 trillion by 2030.

But this explosive growth is clashing headfirst with a major bottleneck: compute.

Legacy data centers are struggling to keep up. They devour over 200 TWh of electricity, guzzle millions of liters of water for cooling, and require massive land, capital, and energy resources. Just one ChatGPT query? It can indirectly consume up to 0.5 liters of water.

Costs are rising. Innovation is slowing. And access is becoming a privilege, not a right.

That’s where Neurolov steps in.

## NeuroSwarm: Powering AI from Your Browser
Our core product, NeuroSwarm, flips the script. It’s the world’s first browser-based decentralized GPU marketplace, built on Solana and powered by WebGPU.

No apps. No installations. Just your browser.

Anyone can open a tab and contribute idle GPU power. In return, they earn $NLOV tokens, while startups, developers, and enterprises rent GPU compute at up to 40 to 70% lower costs than traditional cloud providers.

Today, 15,000+ active nodes across 26 countries contribute 10 million TFLOPs of decentralized power with 99.99% uptime. Real-world use cases include:
- Orbiter Neural
- Helixo AI
- Model Labs

It’s simple, powerful, and live.

## A $12M Leap Forward: Government Backing DePIN at Scale
The $12M MoU signed at Vibrant Gujarat 2025 marks a major turning point.

This isn’t just a partnership. It’s proof that decentralized infrastructure is ready for the real world. Backed by Chief Minister Bhupendra Bhai Patel, the agreement enables Neurolov to deliver decentralized GPU power for critical public initiatives.

For the first time, a national government is actively partnering with a browser-based compute network, a DePIN milestone on a global scale.

## The Engine: $NLOV — A Token With Real Utility
Powering the Neurolov ecosystem is $NLOV, our native token designed for real-world AI utility:
- Fixed supply: 500 million
- Compute fuel: Used by developers to rent GPUs at up to 40 to 70% savings
- Earnable: Contributors earn $NLOV by sharing idle GPU resources
- Stakeable: Institutions stake $NLOV for priority access and scalability

This isn’t a speculative token. It’s a core part of the decentralized AI economy, already powering AI model training, 3D rendering, LLM compute, and more.

## Who’s It For? Everyone
Neurolov is purpose-built for a wide range of users:
- AI Developers: Get fast, affordable compute — no infra needed
- Startups: Scale models without burning through cash
- Gamers & Students: Earn from idle GPU power in minutes
- Researchers: Publish and monetize open-source models
- Retail Creators: Generate AI content using no-code tools
- Governments & Enterprises: Tap into eco-friendly, scalable GPU power

## A Sustainable Future, Built-In
Centralized compute doesn’t just cost money, it costs the planet.

Neurolov’s model uses existing consumer hardware, reducing e-waste, water usage, and energy consumption. We don’t build data centers. We unlock what already exists, making AI greener and more accessible.

It’s why governments and climate-conscious enterprises are turning to us.
