# Passive Income Was a Dream. Until It Became a Browser Tab.
---
For years, “passive income” has been a buzzword thrown around by marketers and YouTubers.

Crypto miners spent thousands on rigs. Others staked and waited months.

But what if true passive income didn’t need any of that?

What if it was as simple as opening a browser tab and letting it run in the background?

That’s the promise of NeuroSwarm.

No mining equipment. No staking requirements. Just raw, unused compute power contributing to a decentralized AI ecosystem — and earning tokens in return.

We didn’t just reimagine passive income.  
We made it practical.
