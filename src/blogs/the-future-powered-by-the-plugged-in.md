# The Future Isn’t Built by the Loud. It’s Powered by the Plugged In.

While the world rushes toward artificial intelligence, only a few stop to ask: Who will power it all?

Right now, billions of devices sit idle for hours each day — phones, laptops, desktops — full of unused processing power.

What if that power wasn’t wasted? What if it could earn for you, not just Big Tech?

NeuroSwarm is a new way to tap into this silent force. A decentralized network powered entirely through browsers. No installations. No friction. No gatekeepers.

If your device is connected, it’s capable. If you’re plugged in, you’re already part of the future.

NeuroSwarm isn’t coming for your attention. It’s coming for your idle power.

And it will reward you for it.
